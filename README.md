# What is OpenSpaces?

OpenSpaces is the top layer of [XAP](http://www.gigaspaces.com/xap) - a powerful, scalable **In-Memory Data Grid**. OpenSpaces is a package which wraps the core XAP functionality with a user-friendly Spring-based API, as well as additional patterns which have become common across many users and are now part of the library.

This repository is mirrored from the actual source code, and is provided for users interested in learning more about how XAP works under the hood by reading or debugging the code. Since it is a mirror, we do not accept pull requests, but if you have feedback we'd be happy to hear it via the [Community Forum](http://ask.gigaspaces.org/questions/). 

If you're new to XAP, we recommend downloading the trial version (or the free community edition) from the [download center](http://www.gigaspaces.com/xap-download) and follow this [tutorial](http://docs.gigaspaces.com/sbp/first-xap-app.html).
