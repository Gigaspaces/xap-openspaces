/**
 * A replication redo log overflow to disk alert configurer. The alert is raised if a redo log has
 * exceeded the defined memory capacity and excess packets are being written to disk. The alert is
 * resolved once the disk is no longer in use.
 * <p>
 * When target space is unavailable, replication packets are stored in the redo log (a.k.a backlog).
 * If the capacity of the memory redo log exceeds, the disk is used. Once the target reconnects, the
 * backlog is transmitted. When the disk is no longer in use, a resolution alert is triggered. On
 * the other hand, if the disk redo log capacity exceeds, then the redo log is cleared and target
 * will sync upon recovery. When the redo log is cleared the disk is no longer in use and an alert
 * will be triggered as well.
 * <p>
 * Use the call to {@link #create()} to create a fully initialized
 * {@link ReplicationRedoLogOverflowToDiskAlertConfiguration} configuration.
