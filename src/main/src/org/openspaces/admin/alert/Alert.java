/**
 * An interface representing an alert issued by an alert bean or an alert provider.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * An alert has a unique alert id ({@link #getAlertUid()}) and is fired by one of the alert beans,
 * and aggregated with other alerts of the same ({@link #getGroupUid()}).
 * <p>
 * An <b>unresolved</b> alert is an alert that indicates a problematic situation that needs
 * attention. An alert bean can trigger more than one unresolved alert if the problem persists (with
 * the same alert group UID). A <b>resolved</b> alert ({@link AlertStatus#RESOLVED}) is an alert that
 * indicates that the situation was resolved, or is no longer in need of attention.
 * <p>
 * Each alert has descriptive information of the alert ({@link #getDescription()}), data and time of
 * the alert ({@link #getTimestamp()}), and configuration properties together with runtime
 * properties the alert bean exposes (see {@link #getProperties()}).
 * <p>
 * The source component for which the alert was triggered (see {@link #getComponentUid()}) can be
 * correlated to one of the components using the {@link Admin#getGridComponentByUID(String)} if this
 * component has not yet been terminated.
