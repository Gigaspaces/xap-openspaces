/**
 * A weakly-typed configuration API based on the 'builder' patterns for a more convenient
 * code-fluent approach to configuring an {@link AlertBeanConfig}.
 * <p>
 * The fully configured {@link AlertBeanConfig} object is returned by the call to
 * {@link #getConfig()}.
 * <p>
 * By default, the configuration is empty - has no properties set. The
 * {@link #applyRecommendedSettings()} can be used to set the recommended setting for all
 * configuration properties.
