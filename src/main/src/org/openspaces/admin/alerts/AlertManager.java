/**
 * An alert manager is a manager for alerts issued by alert beans or alert providers.
 * <p>
 * The alert manager provides two options for configuration of alert beans: A strongly typed
 * configuration based on an implementation of {@link AlertBeanConfig}, or a weakly typed
 * configuration based on String key-value property pairs (see {@link BeanPropertiesManager}).
 * <p>
 * To Register/Unregister for alert events (of all types), add/remove {@link AlertEventListener}s
 * exposed by the {@link AlertEventManager} API.
 * <p>
 * The {@link #fireAlert(Alert)} method call allows alert beans to 'fire' an alert and trigger an
 * event to be sent to all registered alert event listeners.
 * <p>
 * An alert provider is a remote service implementing an {@link AlertProvider} interface. A
 * dedicated alert bean needs to be configured to periodically perform remote calls to poll issued
 * alerts (see {@link AlertProvider#getAlerts()}), and 'fire' them to local alert event listeners.
