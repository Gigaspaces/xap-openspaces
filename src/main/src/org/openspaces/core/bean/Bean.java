/**
 * A simple bean construct with resemblance to a Spring bean (interfaces InitializingBean,
 * DisposableBean).
 * <p>
 * The administrative Bean is configured by either a strongly typed API (see {@link BeanConfig}), or
 * by a weakly typed String key-value pair property API (see {@link BeanConfigPropertiesManager}).
 * These properties are supplied upon the bean's construction (see {@link #setProperties(Map)}).
 * <p>
 * A request to set a bean's configuration (see {@link BeanConfigManager#setBeanConfig(BeanConfig)}
 * ), will store the configuration properties at the server until the bean is enabled (or removed).
 * <p>
 * A request to enable a bean (see {@link BeanConfigManager#enableBean(Class)}), will be accepted by
 * the bean factory - which initializes the bean, sets the properties and invokes a call to
 * {@link #afterPropertiesSet()}.
 * <p>
 * A request to disable a bean (see {@link BeanConfigManager#disableBean(Class)}), will destroy the
 * bean ({@link #destroy()}). The configuration properties will remain at the server until the bean
 * is completely removed (see {@link BeanConfigManager#removeBeanConfig(Class)}).
 * <p>
 * A request to set a bean with different properties (see
 * {@link BeanConfigManager#setBeanConfig(BeanConfig)}), will destroy the bean if it is already
 * enabled, and re-enable it with the new configuration properties. If the bean wasn't enabled, the
 * properties are stored at the server until the bean is enabled (or removed).
