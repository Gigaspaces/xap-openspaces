/**
 * An implementation of IDataProcessor. Can set the simulated work done when
 * processData is called by setting the work duration (defaults to 100 ms).
 *
 * <p>This implementation is used to demonstrate two features of OpenSpaces. The
 * first is OpenSpaces Events, using simple Spring configuration to cause
 * processData to be invoked when a matching event occurs. The processor uses
 * OpenSpaces support for annotation markup allowing to use @SpaceDataEvent to
 * mark a method as an event listener. Note, processData does not use any space
 * API (though it can), receiving the Data object to be processed and returning
 * the result that will be automatically written back to the space.
 *
 * <p>Note, changing the event container is just a matter of configuration (for example,
 * switching from polling container to notify container) and does not affect this class.
 *
 * <p>Also note, the deployment model or the Space topology does not affect this data processor
 * as well. The data processor can run on a remote space, embedded within a space, and using
 * any Space cluster topology (partitioned, replicated, primary/backup). It is all just a
 * matter of configuration.
 *
 * <p>The second feature is OpenSpaces remoting, allowing to expose this implementation
 * of IDataProcessor to other processing units (or any other client) to be invoked.
 * The invocation is done using the Space as the transport layer benefiting from all
 * the Space built in features (HA, Load Balancing).
