/**
 * A data counter that periodically performs a count on the space and updates
 * its count of data objects.
 *
 * <p>Note, since we simply use the GigaSpace API, with a "null" Data object
 * template, we simply count how many data objects are in the space. In our
 * example, we show how a Local View can be used to hold all the processed
 * data objects, and the count is executed on it. The Local View exposes the
 * same API as the Space.
 *
 * <p>Also note, this of course can be implemented in many different ways,
 * one of them is using notifications (using the notify container), and another
 * would be to execute the count against the actual space (without a view).
 * This bean is here to show how LocalView can be used.
