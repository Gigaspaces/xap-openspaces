Creates a basic SBA application with three processing units. The Feeder
processing unit sends Data objects through the Space to a Processor.
The Space and the Processor are collocated in the same processing unit.
The Processor is connected to a Mirror and provides a reliable asynchronous
replication and persistency to the Database using Hibernate.
JVM: >= 5.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION:
--------------------

  The project consists of three modules: common, processor, feeder and mirror. The common
module includes all the shared resources and classes between both the processor
and the feeder. In our case, the common module includes the "Data" class which
is written and taken from the Space.

  The processor module, which is a processing unit, starts up a Space and on top of
it starts a polling container that performs a take from the Space of unprocessed Data
entries. The take operation results in an "event" that will end up executing the 
"Processor" class. The Processor "processes" the Data object (by setting its processed
flag to true) and returns it. The return value is automatically written back to the Space.
  Any changes done on the processor Space are replicated in a reliable asynchronous manner to the 
mirror processing unit which in turn persist the changes to the database. When the processor
starts up, it loads all its relevant data from the database and initializes the Space with it.
  The processor also comes with both a unit test and integration test that verifies its behavior.

  The mirror module is a very simple module which includes just a mirror Space. The mirror Space
uses the Hibernate external data source in order to persist changes to the database using 
Hibernate. The processor connects to the mirror in a reliable asynchronous manner and replicates
changes done on its Space to the mirror.

  The feeder module, which is also a processing unit, connects to a Space remotely and
writes unprocessed Data objects to the Space (resulting in events firing up within
the processor processing unit).

To view the HSQL database created by the mirror service invoke mvn os:hsql-ui.

BUILDING, PACKAGING, RUNNING, DEPLOYING
---------------------------------------

Quick list:

* mvn compile: Compiles the project.
* mvn os:run: Runs the project.
* mvn test: Runs the tests in the project.
* mvn package: Compiles and packages the project.
* mvn os:run-standalone: Runs a packaged application (from the jars).
* mvn os:deploy: Deploys the project onto the Service Grid.
* mvn os:undeploy: Removes the project from the Service Grid.
* mvn os:hsql-ui: To view the HSQL database created by the mirror service

  In order to build the example, a simple "mvn compile" executed from the root of the 
project will compile all the different modules.

  Packaging the application can be done using "mvn package" (note, by default, it also
runs the tests, in order to disable it, use -DskipTests). The packaging process jars up 
the common module. The feeder, processor and mirror modules packaging process creates a 
"processing unit structure" directory within the target directory called [app-name]-[module].
It also creates a jar from the mentioned directory called [app-name]-[module].jar.

  In order to simply run the mirror, processor and feeder (after compiling), "mvn os:run" can be used.
This will run a single instance of each of the mirror, processor and feeder modules within
the same JVM using the compilation level classpath (no need for packaging). 
A specific module can also be executed by itself, which in this case, executing
more than one instance of the processing unit can be done. For example, running the processor
module with a cluster topology of 2 partitions, each with one backup, the following command
can be used: mvn os:run -Dmodule=processor -Dcluster="total_members=2,1".

  In order to run a packaged processing unit, "mvn package os:run-standalone" can be used (if
"mvn package" was already executed, it can be omitted). This operation will run the processing units
using the packaged jar files. Running a specific module with a cluster topology can be executed using:
mvn package os:run-standalone -Dmodule=processor -Dcluster="total_members=2,1".

  Deploying the application requires starting up a GSM and at least 2 GSCs (scripts located under
the bin directory within the GigaSpaces installation). Once started, running "mvn package os:deploy"
will deploy the two processing units. 
  When deploying, the SLA elements within each processing unit descriptor (pu.xml) are taken into 
account. This means that by default when deploying the application, 2 partitions, each with 
one backup will be created for the processor, a single instance of the feeder will be created,
and a single instance of the mirror will be created.

  A special note regarding groups and deployment: If the GSM and GSCs were started under a specific 
group, the -Dgroups=[group-name] will need to be used in the deploy command.

WORKING WITH ECLIPSE
--------------------

  In order to generate eclipse project the following command need to be executed from the root of
the application: "mvn eclipse:eclipse". Pointing the Eclipse import existing project wizard
to the application root directory will result in importing the three modules.
If this is a fresh Eclipse installation, the M2_REPO needs be defined and pointed to the local 
maven repository (which resides under USER_HOME/.m2/repository).

After generating the projects, configure them to work with maven:
for each project, right click on it and select Configure > Convert to Maven Project.

  The application itself comes with built in launch targets allowing to run the mirror, processor 
and the feeder using Eclipse run (or debug) targets.

A NOTE OF CLUSTERING
--------------------

  This application focus on showing how SBA is used. The processor starts up an embedded Space and 
works directly on it. When deploying 2 partitions of the processor, two embedded spaces (within the
same cluster) will be created, with each polling container working only on the cluster member it 
started in an in memory and transactional manner. This is the power of such an architecture, where
the processing of the Data happens in a collocated manner with the Data. 
  If we want to add High Availability to the processor, we can deploy 2 partitions, each with 
one backup (2,1). In this case, the processor instances that ends up starting a cluster member 
Space which is the backup will not perform any processing since the polling container identifies the 
Space state and won't perform the take operation. If one of the processor primaries instances will 
fail, the backup instance will become primary (with an up to date data), and its polling container 
will start processing all the relevant Data. Note, when deploying on top of the Service Grid, the 
Service Grid will also identify that one instance failed, and will automatically start it over in 
another container (GSC).

  The mirror provides a transparent persistency model which does not affect the latency of the main
path of the application (writing and processing Data objects). The processor connects to the mirror 
and replicates in a reliable asynchronous manner changes done on it to the mirror Space. The reliable aspects 
is achieved thanks to the fact that the processor has a backup Space for each partition. When the 
mirror fails, the processor Spaces will accumulate the relevant changes until the Service Grid will
create a new instance of it. The changes will then be replicated to the mirror.
  The mirror itself uses built in Hibernate external data source which uses Hibernate in order to 
persist all the relevant changes to the database.
  When the processor starts up, each primary Space of each partition will load all the relevant data
from the database using its their own configured Hibernate external data source.

  The feeder works with a clustered view of the Space (the 2,1 cluster topology looking as one), and 
simply writes unprocessed Data objects to the Space. The routing (@SpaceRouting) controls to which
partition the unprocessed Data will be written and consequently which instance will process it.

A NOTE ON DATABASE
------------------

  The project uses HSQLDB in as a database in order to provide the best out of the box experience. The
mirror starts an instance of HSQLDB and connects to it. The processor connects to the HSQLDB database
as well. HSQLDB stores its data in under the USER_HOME directory.
  In order to switch to another database, the bean that starts up HSQLDB should be removed. The JDBC
data source connection string should point to the new Database in both the mirror and processor. And
Hibernate should be configured with a different Database Dialect.
  Note that the mirror and the processor are configured to use a database that runs on the localhost.
In order to run the mirror and the processor on different machines change the url of the dataSource
element in the pu.xml file of the processor to use host of the mirror.
